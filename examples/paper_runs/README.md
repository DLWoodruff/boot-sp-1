# paper_runs

This directory contains "frozen" versions of everything needed to
create the tables in the paper.  If you need to run the slurm scripts
as bash scripts you will have to edit them a little bit. Needless to say,
if you need to run the slurm scripts on a machine other than the one
they are intended for, you will also have to edit them a little bit!
