Simulate
========

The simulation software is `simulate_boot.py`.

Overview
--------

The idea behind simulation mode is that a researcher has a problem with a known, or presumed, optimal solution. They may also have a candidate solution (xhat) that they have computed, but they could have it computed by the simulation software
if their module has proper support (see `optional`_).

a json file is ``boot-sp/examples/famer.json``.
