We consider various combinations of distribution estimation and resampling (bootstrap and bagging) for 
obtaining samples used to acquire a solution and for computing a confidence interval for an optimality 
gap, see paper "Distributions and Bootstrap for Data-based Stochastic Programming".

Notes
-----

- Both "smoothed_B_I" and "smoothed_center_sample_size" are required in the json options even though 
one of them is needed.
